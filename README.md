## NativeOrientationWidget
Make your page designs orientation aware in a simple way.

## Features

For example, in portrait, render your dashboard by placing four buttons in two layout grid rows. But in landscape, show all four buttons in one row.

## Usage
Place content in the two content area's, separate for portrait and landscape. Be sure to use snippets to avoid duplicating your page content.

## Known issues
Due to a bug in React Native, this widget only works well on Android. On iOS, the orientation is reported incorrectly so the widget shows the wrong container
